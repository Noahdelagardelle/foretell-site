    <meta name="description" content="Massive data is available at a click of our finger tips today and itâ€™s only going to increase as internet of things become a part of our daily matrix of life. Convergence of sciences, technology and the arts is driving us to create adaptive learning systems. New platforms are emerging daily to help us understand how we can leverage this data clusters to create engaging user experiences. Designers today need to learn how to collect, index, analyze and interpret various data points from these novel and traditional sources to enhance decision making. Our solutions need to be holistic, comprehensive and accurate to solve these complex problems. The next generation of designers have to spend a lot more time researching various data patterns to create meaningful interactions for our users.">

            <h4>Smart Loops</h4>
            <h5>Rachel Ries</h5>
            <p>Smart Loops is a smart park that introduces technology
              and nature together by bringing people to the park to
              create smarter outcomes. Technology is something that
              will always be growing so why not encourage your family
              and friends to interact with nature and being outdoors at
              the same time? Smart Loops sends geo-location alerts to
              people neart the park to tell them about events and activities
              happening at the park. Artifi cial intelligence allows us
              to discover new ideas while teaching users about nature
              and involvement outdoors. With Smart Loops, we allow
              you to interact with your friends and family on social media
              as well. We help you get involved with the community and
              volunteering by receiving notifi cations from our app.</p>
