    <meta name="description" content="Massive data is available at a click of our finger tips today and it’s only going to increase as internet of things become a part of our daily matrix of life. Convergence of sciences, technology and the arts is driving us to create adaptive learning systems. New platforms are emerging daily to help us understand how we can leverage this data clusters to create engaging user experiences. Designers today need to learn how to collect, index, analyze and interpret various data points from these novel and traditional sources to enhance decision making.
