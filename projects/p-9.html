    <meta name="description" content="Massive data is available at a click of our finger tips today and itâ€™s only going to increase as internet of things become a part of our daily matrix of life. Convergence of sciences, technology and the arts is driving us to create adaptive learning systems. New platforms are emerging daily to help us understand how we can leverage this data clusters to create engaging user experiences. Designers today need to learn how to collect, index, analyze and interpret various data points from these novel and traditional sources to enhance decision making. Our solutions need to be holistic, comprehensive and accurate to solve these complex problems. The next generation of designers have to spend a lot more time researching various data patterns to create meaningful interactions for our users.">

            <h4>Phuze</h4>
            <h5>Tayler Gerou</h5>
            <p>To truly progress in the world one needs to have a strong grasp on the digital and analog world around us; one without the other will cause people to feel unbalanced. Phuze is an educational initiative that helps students refocus on the world, using mindfulness and photographic practices. Phuze is broken down into two, two week sections and the first week teaches core photography skills with the use of Arch, the AI app. The second two weeks dials in on mindfulness practices with the use of lm photography. Mindfulness is about being present in ones surroundings and making a conscious choice about where to place ones attention. Through repeated practice of being mindful, a person can help reduce depression, anxiety, and ADHD while increasing cognitive thinking, creativity and much more. Phuze is the key element in helping students to rethink, refocus, and think independently so they can change and improve the world around them.</p>
